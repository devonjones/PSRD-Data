    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">These vambraces are constructed of polished steel. When a paladin wears these vambraces, engravings of the holy symbol of a paladin's deity and other religious iconography mystically appear upon the metal's surface. Once per day, when the paladin uses her lay on hands ability, she can choose to apply an additional mercy to that use of lay on hands that she did not already select. She must be of sufficient level to use that mercy. </p>",
