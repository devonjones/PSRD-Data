A single dose is sufficient to form a 5-foot radius circle, with each additional dose increasing the circle's radius by 5 feet. The area within the circle remains consecrated for 1 hour per dose, though any corporeal creature can spend a standard action to break the circle and end the effect prematurely. A newly created pouch of <i>grave salt</i> holds 5 doses.</p>",
