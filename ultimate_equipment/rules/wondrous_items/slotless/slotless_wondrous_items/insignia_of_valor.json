    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This metal badge of a rampant griffon, lion, horse, or similar heraldic creature must be attached to a shield or armor to function. Attaching or removing it requires a DC 15 Craft (armor) check, 10 minutes, and appropriate tools. Its powers only function if the wearer of the shield or armor has the channel energy and smite abilities. If the wearer dispatches an opponent with a smite attack (killing it, destroying it, or reducing its hit points below 0), she may expend one use of her channel energy ability as a swift action that round.</p>",
