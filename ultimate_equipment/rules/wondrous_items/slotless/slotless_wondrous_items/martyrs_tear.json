    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This imperfect, rose-tinted gemstone resembles a teardrop or a broken heart depending on its orientation. Its pale facets are typically marred by a single crack or chip near the gem's middle.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Once per day, the bearer may spend a standard action to transfer 3d6 hit points from himself into the gem. This deepens the gem's color, with a stronger color indicating more life energy stored in it. The gem can store a maximum of 18 hit points. If any hit points are stored in the gem, the bearer may touch it himself or another creature as a standard action, transferring all the stored life energy from the gem to the target creature, healing it a number of hit points equal to the amount stored in the gem. This returns the gem to its normal color.</p>",
