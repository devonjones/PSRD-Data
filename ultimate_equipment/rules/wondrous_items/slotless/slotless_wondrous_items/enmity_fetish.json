    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This small talisman is comprised of teeth, fingers, ears, or other grotesque trophies taken from the freshly dead. Each talisman is imbued with an intense animosity toward a particular type of creature, chosen from the ranger favored enemy list when the fetish is created. Once per day, the talisman can impart this animosity to a ranger (or other character with the favored enemy class feature), replacing one of his favored enemies with the fetish's designated creature type. This lasts 24 hours. To activate the fetish, the ranger must spend 10 minutes quietly holding it; he then may select one of his favored enemies to replace with the item's favored enemy. For example, a ranger with a +6 favored enemy bonus against orcs may use a dragon-hating fetish, gaining a +6 favored enemy bonus against dragons and losing the bonus against orcs for 24 hours. Alternatively, once per day, the bearer can activate the fetish as a swift action, but its effects only last 10 minutes and the bearer only gains half his favored enemy bonus (for example, the ranger would lose his orc bonus and only gain a +3 favored enemy bonus against dragons for 10 minutes).</p>",
