During the day, half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. At night, the device focuses distant starlight, and the maximum damage is only 10d6, although the lens does not function at all for 1 hour before sunrise and 1 hour after sunset.

The user can alter both the damage (up to the maximum for the current lighting conditions) and the orbit in any direction, but the lens must move 20 feet each round, and cannot travel more than 3 miles from the temple in any direction before it curves back around and begins returning. Only divine intervention or powerful magic like <i>wish </i>or <i>miracle</i> can overcome this limited range, making a new person or place the center of the lens's orbit.</p>",

Atop the massive storm cloud, the castle is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at each corner. At its center is a 140-foot tower with seven levels and more than 30 chambers. The central tower is well appointed with many halls, living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens (with pantries that magically replenish food stores every fortnight), and laboratories suitable for arcane and alchemical study. Each guard tower has living chambers and barracks for up to 25 guards, and one tower has an adjoining stable that can hold up to a dozen griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even terrestrial mounts. In all, the tower can comfortably support a population of 300 Medium creatures. </p><p class=\"stat-block\">In order to fully take control of the castle, a creature must be at least 17th level, and must have the Leadership feat and 17 ranks in Knowledge (arcana). If the castle already has a master, that master must be defeated before another can take her place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a control chamber located at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th floor). There, a font of pure elemental water serves as a scrying device for the castle's master, though it can view only places inside the castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a person she designates) can direct the castle's motion from within the chamber. It has a fly speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the Fly skill modifier of the person controlling its motion; the castle can hover without needing to make a Fly check and never risks falling due to a failed check. When not being controlled, the castle moves randomly, sometimes changing direction every minute, sometimes holding the same course for days at a time, but always avoiding the ground or other hazards. It has the ability to travel to other planes, though no master other than the Storm King is known to have invoked this power. The master of the castle gains the following spell-like abilities.</p><ul><li>Call lightning storm 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber or one of the towers to use this ability.</li><li><i>Guards and wards</i> 1/day on the central tower.</li><li><i>Storm of vengeance</i> 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber to use this ability, and the storm rains down from the castle's cloudy base upon everything within range underneath (2,200 feet).</li><li><i>Wind wall</i> at will. This effect surrounds the entire castle at a range of 100 feet, and can be raised or lowered by the master (or a creature he or she designates) from the control room or any tower as a standard action.</li></ul>",

Anyone opening the <i>Codex </i>for the first time is utterly annihilated, as with a <i>destruction</i> spell (Fortitude DC 30). Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers, though not without risk. Each day spent studying the <i>Codex </i>allows the reader to make a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a +1 circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent reading until a power is learned). However, each day of study also forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as the <i>insanity</i> spell). The powers of the <i>Codex of the Infinite Planes </i>are as follows: <i>astral projection ,  banishment ,  elemental swarm ,  gate ,  greater planar ally ,  greater planar binding ,  plane shift , </i>and <i>soul bind . </i>Each of these spell-like abilities are usable at will by the owner of the <i>Codex </i>(assuming that he or she has learned how to access the power). The <i>Codex of the Infinite Planes </i>has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the power; the character can't take 10 on this check). Any failure on either check indicates that a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below for the effect). A character can incur only one catastrophe per power use. </p>",

Spell resistance is not useful against this effect. Each <i>Orb of Dragonkind </i>bestows upon the wielder the AC and saving throw bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the <i>Orb. </i>A character possessing an <i>Orb of Dragonkind </i>is immune to the breath weapon&mdash;but only the breath weapon&mdash;of the dragon variety keyed to the <i>Orb. </i>Finally, a character possessing an <i>Orb </i>can herself use the breath weapon of the dragon in the <i>Orb </i>three times per day.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">All <i>Orbs of Dragonkind</i> can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other <i>Orbs</i>. The owner of an <i>Orb</i> knows if there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons of the <i>Orb's</i> particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the <i>Orb's</i> variety, the wielder can determine the dragon's exact location and age. The bearer of one of these <i>Orbs</i> earns the enmity of dragonkind forever for profiting by draconic enslavement, even if she later loses the item. Each <i>Orb</i> also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at caster level 10th.</p><ul><li><i>Black Dragon Orb</i><i>Fly</i>.</li><li><i>Blue Dragon Orb</i>: <i>Haste</i>.</li><li><i>Brass Dragon Orb</i>: <i>Teleport</i>.</li><li><i>Bronze Dragon Orb</i>: <i>Scrying</i> (Will DC 18 negates).</li><li><i>Copper Dragon Orb</i>: <i>Suggestion</i> (Will DC 17 negates).</li><li><i>Gold Dragon Orb</i>: The owner of the gold <i>Orb</i> can call upon any power possessed by one of the other <i>Orbs</i>&mdash;including the dominate and breath weapon abilities but not AC, save bonuses, or breath weapon immunity&mdash;but can use an individual power only once per day.
