    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">You can use this smelly, silvery paste to temporarily repair metal objects. It is sold in a sealed flask and reacts with air, turning solid in 1d6+4 minutes. You must make an appropriate DC 20 Craft check to repair a metal item with the broken condition; success means the object loses the broken condition but gains the fragile condition (see page 22). Increase the DC by +5 if the broken object is a magic item or by +5 if it is a firearm (add both modifiers if the item is a magical firearm). If the check fails, the mending paste is consumed but you may try again with another flask or conventional repair methods.</p>",
