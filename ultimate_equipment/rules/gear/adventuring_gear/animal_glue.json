    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This simple glue is created by extensively boiling animal skin, bones, hooves, horn, and tendons until they turn into a ochre syrup that cools when it hardens. Before you use animal glue, you must heat it until it liquefies. You normally apply it with a brush and hold the pieces together for a minute, at which point it is cooled and hardened. The glue is sufficient to coat 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste and spills) up to 40 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each. Pulling apart a large glued surface (at least 1 square foot) requires a DC 15 Strength check. Pulling apart a small glued surface (anything less than 1 square foot) requires a DC 10 Strength check. Animal glue slowly dissolves in water, reducing the Strength DC needed to break it by 1 per 10 minutes. It softens if heated, even with steam, reducing the Strength DC needed to break it by 1 per minute.</p>",
