A <i>lifesurge </i>weapon boosts and sustains the wielder's life energy while he is in the throes of combat. The wielder gains a bonus on saving throws against necromantic effects&mdash;including the ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain powers of the undead&mdash;equal to the weapon's enhancement bonus. In addition, whenever the wielder receives temporary hit points from any source, he adds the weapon's enhancement bonus to these temporary hit points; this does not stack for temporary hit points from multiple sources, and these points are lost if the <i>lifesurge </i>weapon is not being wielded.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">In combat, the weapon's critical threat range is doubled against undead; this does not stack with the <i>keen </i>special ability or Improved Critical. Whenever a <i>lifesurge </i>weapon confirms a critical hit against an undead creature, it erupts with 1d8 points of positive energy (2d8 for weapons with a critical multiplier of &times;3, 3d8 if it is &times;4); the wielder may choose to deal this as damage to an undead target or to absorb half this amount as healing, with the remaining positive energy dissipating.</p>",
