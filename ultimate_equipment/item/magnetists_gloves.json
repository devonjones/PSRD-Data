    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">These thin leather gloves have delicate steel wires running through them. Three times per day as a standard action, the wearer of these gloves may attempt a disarm combat maneuver on a target within 30 feet. The target's item must be mostly made of metal. If the combat maneuver check is successful, the target is disarmed and the item falls to the ground in the target's square. For every 5 by which the check exceeds the DC, the item lands 1 square closer to the wearer. If this would place the item in the wearer's square, the wearer may attempt to catch the item with a DC 10 Dexterity check; otherwise it lands in the wearer's square. The wearer can only use this ability if she has at least one hand free. If the wearer fails the combat maneuver check, she is not disarmed.</p>",
