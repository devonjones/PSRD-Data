    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This pink liquid has a horrible chalky taste, but is quite effective at counteracting nausea, indigestion, and diarrhea. A vial of wismuth salix, taken in small doses during the day, alleviates these symptoms. If you drink an entire vial of wismuth salix, for 1 hour you get a +2 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saving throws against effects that inflict the nauseated or sickened condition. If you drink a vial of it while suffering from the nauseated or sickened condition, you may immediately roll another saving throw (with the +2 bonus) against the effect; you may gain this particular benefit only once per day. Drinking a vial of wismuth salix (whether over the course of a day or all at once) usually turns your tongue black for about a day, though this is a harmless side effect.</p>",
