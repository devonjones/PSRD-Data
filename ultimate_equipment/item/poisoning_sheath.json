    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This scabbard contains strips of natural sea sponges on its interior. By carefully pouring a dose of poison into the empty scabbard (a full-round action), you saturate the sponges with the toxin, which keeps it viable and wet for up to 4 hours. Preparing the scabbard carries the normal risk of poisoning yourself, just like poisoning a weapon. The next weapon you draw from the scabbard is automatically poisoned as if you had directly applied poison to it (but does not risk poisoning you); this consumes the poison in the scabbard. A scabbard only fits one type of bladed weapon, such as a dagger, shortsword, or longsword. This kind of item is usually illegal in areas that outlaw poison.</p>",
