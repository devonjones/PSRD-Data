    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This amulet shines brightly when brought within 60 feet of an outsider with the elemental subtype, shedding light as a torch. The amulet glows a different color depending on the subtype of the elemental or elementals present (white for air, yellow for earth, red for fire, and blue for water). If more than one subtype is present, the gem flickers back and forth between the appropriate colors.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The wearer gains resistance 5 against a single energy type determined by the subtype of the closest elemental present (air grants electricity resistance, earth grants acid resistance, fire grants fire resistance, and water grants cold resistance). If the closest elemental possesses multiple subtypes, the wearer may choose which type of resistance she gains. This energy resistance only applies against attacks from elementals. The amulet also allows any attacks made by the wearer to bypass the damage reduction of such creatures.</p>",
