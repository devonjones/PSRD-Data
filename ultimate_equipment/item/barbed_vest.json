    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Thin leather flaps keep the hundreds of tiny, fishhook-like needles dotting the surface of this black vest from harming you while you wear it. However, any creature that injures you with a natural or unarmed attack must make a DC 15 Reflex save or take 1 point of damage. If a creature swallows you, it takes 1 point of damage each round until it either spits you up, you escape, or you die (at which point the vest has sustained enough damage that it no longer serves as a threat). The vest can only be worn over light armor or no armor.</p>",
