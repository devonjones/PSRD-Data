    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This tome bestows the ability to use the spells within its pages upon any bearer of any class. However, a bearer not already able to use spells gains one negative level for as long as the book is in her possession or while she makes use of its powers. A book of infinite spells contains 1d8+22 pages. The nature of each page is determined by a d% roll: 01&ndash;50, arcane spell; 51&ndash;100, divine spell. Determine the exact spell randomly.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back&mdash;paging through the book is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Once per day, the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one that is on the character's class spell list, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without destroying the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as if from a scroll, nor can they be copied into a spellbook&mdash;their magic is bound permanently within the book itself.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The owner of the book need not have the book in her possession in order to use its power. The book can be stored elsewhere and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power, so long as no other creature attempts to make use of the book, in so doing becoming its owner.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the energy connected with its use causes the page to magically turn despite all precautions. The chance of a page turning depends on the spell the page contains and what sort of spellcaster the owner is.</p>",
