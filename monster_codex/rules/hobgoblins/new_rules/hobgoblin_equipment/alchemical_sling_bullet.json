    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Used by hobgoblin alchemists to equip their comrades, these spherical glass vials can each be filled with 1 dose of an alchemical splash weapon, allowing them to be used as ammunition for a sling. On a hit, an alchemical sling bullet shatters, affecting the target with the alchemical solution within. This deals only the splash weapon's damage (if any), not the damage a sling bullet would normally deal. This attack resolves against the target's normal AC (rather than touch AC) as with a standard sling bullet, and uses the sling's range. An alchemical sling bullet does not deal splash damage to squares adjacent to the target. If an attack roll with an alchemical sling bullet misses, the bullet and its alchemical contents are destroyed, and do not risk detonating in another square.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Filling an alchemical sling bullet is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and you must succeed at a DC 15 Craft (alchemy) or Sleight of Hand check to avoid spilling the alchemical item on yourself. On a failed check, the splash weapon explodes in your square as though you were targeted by the item (including any splash effects on adjacent squares).</p>",
