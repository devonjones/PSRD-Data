    "body": "<p>At 7th level, while a pack rager is raging, she grants a single teamwork feat she knows to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her. She chooses the feat at the start of the rage, and cannot change it during the rage. An ally who moves more than 30 feet away from the raging pack rager loses access to the feat, but regains it again each time he moves back within 30 feet of the raging pack rager. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p><p>At 13th level, the pack rager chooses two teamwork feats when she enters a rage, and grants her allies the use of both of those feats when they are within 30 feet of her.</p><p>At 16th level, the pack rager grants these teamwork feats as long as her allies are within 60 feet of her.</p><p>At 19th level, the pack rager chooses three teamwork feats when she enters a rage, and grants her allies the use of all three feats when they are within 60 feet of her.</p><p>This ability replaces the damage reduction class feature.</p>",
