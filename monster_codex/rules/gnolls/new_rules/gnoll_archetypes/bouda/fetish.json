    "body": "<p>A bouda keeps a small fetish: sometimes a carved idol, other times a necklace adorned with teeth or bones. A bouda's spells come from the will of evil spirits residing in the fetish, and its ability to hold spells functions in a manner identical to the way a witch's spells are granted by her familiar. The bouda must commune with her fetish each day to prepare her spells and can only prepare spells stored in the fetish.</p><p>At 3rd level, a bouda can use her fetish to deliver touch spells a number of times per day equal to 1/4 her witch level (minimum 1). When casting a touch spell, as a free action she can use this ability. When she does, she can deliver her spell as a ranged touch spell within a range of 30 feet. At 10th level, she can deliver these spells within a range of 60 feet. At 15th level and higher, she can deliver these spells within a range of 90 feet.</p><p>This ability replaces the familiar class feature.</p>",
