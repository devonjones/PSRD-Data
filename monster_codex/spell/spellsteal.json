    "body": "<p>You create a discordant blast of energy that disrupts the target's available magic and transfers knowledge of that magic to you.</p><p>If the target prepares spells, it must choose one of its prepared 3rd-level spells, which is immediately lost. If the target has no 3rd-level spells prepared, it loses a 2nd-level spell it has prepared. This progresses down to a 1st-level spell if the target has no 2nd-level spells prepared, and this spell has no effect if the target also has no 1st-level spells prepared. If the spell is on your spell list, you can cast this lost spell (using your caster level) on your next turn.</p><p>If the target is a spontaneous spellcaster, it loses one of its available 3rd-level spell slots. If the target has no available 3rd-level spell slots, it must lose a 2nd-level spell slot (progressing as above). Randomly select one of the target's spells known of that spell level; if that spell is on your spell list, you can cast it (using your caster level) on your next turn.</p><p>You must provide any focus or material components to cast the stolen spell.</p><p>If the target has more than one spellcasting class, choose one at random to be affected. This spell has no effect on spell-like abilities.</p><p>Any spell or spell slot lost because of this spell is treated as if the caster had failed a concentration check while trying to cast&mdash;the spell or spell slot is wasted and has no effect, but it is recovered normally the next time the character prepares spells or regains spell slots.</p>",
