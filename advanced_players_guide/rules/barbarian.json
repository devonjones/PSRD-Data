Whether a stoic tribal champion who whips herself into a berserker frenzy for the good of her sword-sisters, or a chaotic warrior who revels in carnage for its own sake, all barbarians share a similar approach to combat. Once the red haze of bloodlust descends, there is only a burning rage that carries them through the screaming fray, heedless of wounds and leaving scattered corpses in their wake.</p><p>Presented below are a number of new rage powers to help you customize your barbarian, as well as several classic barbarian archetypes to help you in building your character, each one including a number of suggested rage powers that, while not mandatory, work to flesh out the character concept.
