    "body": "<p id=\"trick-shot\">At 11th level, a zen archer may hit targets that he might otherwise miss. By spending 1 point from his <i>ki</i> pool as a swift action, the zen archer can ignore concealment. By spending 2 points, he can ignore total concealment or cover. By spending 3 points, he can ignore total cover, even firing arrows around corners. The arrow must still be able to reach the target; a target inside a closed building with no open doors or windows cannot be attacked. These effects last for 1 round. This ability replaces diamond body.</p>",
