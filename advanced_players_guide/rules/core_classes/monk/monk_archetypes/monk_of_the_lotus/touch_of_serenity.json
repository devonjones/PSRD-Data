    "body": "<p id=\"touch-of-serenity\">At 1st level, a monk of the lotus gains Touch of Serenity as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 6th level, and every six levels thereafter, the duration of Touch of Serenity increases by 1 round. Each round on its turn, the target may attempt a new Will save to end the effect. This duration does not stack; only the longest remaining duration applies. This ability replaces Stunning Fist.</p>",
