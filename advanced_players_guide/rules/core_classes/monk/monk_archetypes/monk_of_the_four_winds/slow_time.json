    "body": "<p id=\"slow-time\">At 12th level, a monk of the four winds can use his <i>ki</i> to slow time or quicken his movements, depending on the observer. As a swift action, the monk can expend 6 <i>ki</i> points to gain three standard actions during his turn instead of just one. The monk can use these actions to do the following: take a melee attack action, use a skill, use an extraordinary ability, or take a move action. The monk cannot use these actions to cast spells or use spell-like abilities, and cannot combine them to take full-attack actions. Any move actions the monk makes this turn do not provoke attacks of opportunity. This ability replaces abundant step.</p>",
