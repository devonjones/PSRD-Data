If you would normally be denied the ability to act in the surprise round, your initiative is equal to your initiative roll or the roll of your ally &ndash;1, whichever is lower. If both you and your ally would be able to act in the surprise round without the aid of this feat, you may take both a standard and a move action (or a full-round action) during the surprise round.</p>",
