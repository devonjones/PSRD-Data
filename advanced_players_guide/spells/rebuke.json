Half of this damage is sonic damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to sonic-based attacks. <i>Rebuke</i> is especially devastating to foes who worship your god, inflicting 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and stunning them for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the staggering or stunning effect.</p><p>Enemies do not need to hear a <i>rebuke</i> to be harmed by it, but it is negated by magical silence.</p>",
