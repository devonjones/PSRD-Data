    "body": "<p>When casting the spell, you can choose to make the dance either an unending dance or a dance of death.</p><p>A target affected by unending dance receives a new saving throw at the end of each round of dancing, even if its initial save was successful. If the save fails, the duration of the spell increases by 1 round.</p><p>A target affected by the dance of death suffers excruciating pain that inflicts a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, and it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round it spends dancing.</p><p>With either form, you can direct the creature like a marionette as a move action, causing it to take a single move action at half its speed along the path you specify. You must have line of sight to the target and be within Medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) to command its movement. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, and doesn't count against the target's movement on its turn. You can't move a target that succeeded at its initial save against the spell.</p>",
