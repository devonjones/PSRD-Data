The wall automatically attempts a combat maneuver check to pull once per round against any creature that comes in range wearing metal armor, wielding a metal weapon, or otherwise carrying a significant amount of metal.</p><p>The wall's CMB is equal to your caster level plus your tier. If the combat maneuver succeeds, the creature is pulled 5 feet closer to the wall. The wall gains a +5 bonus on its combat maneuver check if the creature is within 5 feet. If the wall succeeds at its check against a creature within 5 feet, the creature is pulled up against the wall and is treated as grappled.</p><p>Dropping metal items or removing metal armor allows a creature to free itself from the wall. The magnetic charge fades after 1 hour per tier. Wrenching an item away from the wall requires a successful Strength check (DC 10 + the wall's CMB).</p>",
