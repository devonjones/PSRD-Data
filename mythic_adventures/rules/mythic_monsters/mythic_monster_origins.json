The following are some examples of how frequently mythic monsters could appear in a particular campaign.</p><ul><li>Some say there is only one mythic red dragon&mdash;the oldest living ancestor of all red dragons&mdash;and it sleeps for centuries at a time.</li><li>A deadly pack of mythic trolls might rule over a hidden realm under the earth. Non-mythic trolls are the least of their kind, cast out because of their inborn weakness.</li><li>There may be only two mythic medusas, both mourning their third sister who was slain by a hero centuries ago. They now breed giant snakes (with a mythic simple template) to send after the hero's descendants.</li><li>A demon lord might imbue some of its servants with mythic power, making them captains and generals over the armies it's amassing to invade the mortal world.</li></ul><p>How prevalent you want mythic creatures to be in your campaign is up to you, and their mythic abilities can be permanent or temporary.</p>",
