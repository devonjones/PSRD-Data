    "body": "<p>Creating a new mythic monster is especially challenging because you're basically creating a monster with two CRs&mdash;an initial CR, which determines its appropriate mythic rank and thus how many mythic abilities it gets, and its final CR, which determines appropriate values for its AC, hit points, damage per round, and so on. Though it's possible to create the monster all at once with a particular CR and MR in mind, it's generally easier to build it in several steps (some of which are very similar to the steps for modifying an existing monster).</p>",
