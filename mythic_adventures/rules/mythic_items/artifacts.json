The <i>hermetic flask</i> and its creations function for only users with the alchemy class feature (<i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</i> 26) and the ability to make extracts. Using the flask normally requires an alchemist's lab or crafting kit. Makeshift tools can be used, but result in a &ndash;5 penalty on all checks.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If a user spends 10 minutes and 100 gp, and succeeds at a DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check, the flask can distill one dose of alchemical essence. If the user expends one use of mythic power during the distilling process, 10 doses are made instead. Alchemical essence remains stable only as long as it's contained within the <i>hermetic flask</i>. As a standard action, an alchemist can pour forth a dose and immediately convert it into an alchemical item worth 100 gp or less, or into a poison worth 1,000 gp or less. He may throw it or apply it as part of the same standard action.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A weapon-like liquid, such as alchemist's fire, congeals into a fragile globule and remains stable until thrown or otherwise broken. Any such substance poured from the flask remains stable for 1 minute, and then dissolves harmlessly. The purity of the alchemical essence increases the effectiveness of alchemical items derived from it. Any save DCs associated with the item increase by 2, and any damage caused or healed by it increases by 50% (including ability damage). The <i>hermetic flask</i> can hold a maximum of 10 doses of alchemical essence at a time.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The user can identify the properties of an unknown alchemical substance or poison by pouring it into an empty <i>hermetic flask</i> and succeeding at a DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check for a normal substance, or a DC 30 or 35 check for a rarer substance. This analysis takes 1 minute and doesn't destroy the substance. Poisons analyzed in the flask can be converted into an antidote as part of this check, consuming the poison in the process. Such an antidote automatically cures the poison in any creature currently suffering from it, and provides immunity to further exposure to that specific poison for 24 hours. The antidote remains stable for as long as it's within the flask, and for 1 minute after it's removed.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">By expending one use of mythic power and using the flask as part of a Craft check, the user can halve the cost of materials needed to create an alchemical item or poison. This doesn't apply to the creation of alchemical essence.</p>",

The following powers don't use charges:</p><ul><li><i>Arcane lock</i></li><li><i>Arcane sight</i></li><li><i>Daylight</i></li><li><i>Knock</i></li><li><i>Mage armor</i></li><li><i>Mage hand</i></li><li><i>Touch of idiocy</i></li></ul><p class=\"stat-block\">The following powers drain 1 charge per use:</p><ul><li><i>Black tentacles</i></li><li><i>Cone of cold</i> (15d6 damage, Reflex DC 20 half)</li><li><i>Fireball</i> (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 18 half)</li><li><i>Greater dispel magic</i></li><li><i>Greater invisibility</i></li><li><i>Greater teleport</i></li><li><i>Lightning arc</i> (15d6 damage, Reflex DC 20 half)</li><li><i>Major image</i> (Will DC 18 disbelief)</li><li><i>Suggestion</i> (Will DC 18 negates)</li></ul><p class=\"stat-block\">These powers drain 2 charges per use:</p><ul><li><i>Summon monster IX</i> (the summoned creatures receive the benefits of the Augment Summoning feat)</li><li><i>Plane shift</i> (Will DC 22 negates, arrive 2 to 200 miles from the intended destination)</li><li><i>Prismatic sphere</i> (DC 24)</li><li><i>Prismatic spray</i> (DC 22)</li></ul><p class=\"stat-block\">For 5 charges, the <i>staff of arcane sovereignty</i> creates a <i>gate</i>.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The <i>staff of eldritch sovereignty</i> has higher DCs than normal for a staff. The wielder still uses her own save DCs if they exceed those of the staff.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The wielder can use any of her metamagic feats on spells cast with the <i>staff of eldritch sovereignty</i> by expending 1 charge per increase in spell level, with a minimum of 1 charge spent. The adjusted level of the spell can't be increased above 9th level. For example, a user with Quicken Spell can spend 5 charges to cast a quickened <i>cone of cold</i> with the staff, but couldn't use it to cast quickened <i>greater teleport</i>.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The wielder can expend one use of mythic power to gain the benefit of a number of charges equal to her mythic tier. Any excess charges are lost. For example, a 5th-tier wielder with Empower Spell could expend one use of mythic power to cast an empowered <i>fireball</i> without consuming any charges from the staff. A wielder who knows the mythic version of one of the staff's spells can cast such spells from the staff by expending one use of mythic power. This can be combined with using mythic power to provide charges. Finally, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to add 1 charge to the staff, with no risk of explosion if the staff is already fully charged.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A <i>staff of eldritch sovereignty</i> gives the wielder spell resistance equal to 23 plus her tier. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can be used to absorb arcane energy directed at its wielder, as a <i>rod of absorption</i> does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough energy to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if the wielder had performed a retributive strike (see Destruction). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her&mdash;the staff doesn't communicate this knowledge as a <i>rod of absorption </i>does. Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.</p>",

Closer inspection reveals it's actually a humanoid heart&mdash;frozen hard, solid, and covered in smooth ice. When clenched in a fist, it feels like it throbs, though the organ remains unmoving and unyielding to the eye. It's said to once have been the heart of a gelugon, and before that it was the heart of a human being. Staring at it causes the surface to gloss over with darkened ice and makes the observer's eyes swim. Once the holder knows to study it, the heart functions as a <i>crystal ball </i>with <i>telepathy</i>.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The heart has a more sinister secret ability. With practice, mythic creatures can use the heart to scry more than just individuals, but entire settlements and cities. As the owner does, her mind becomes flooded with information about the region. Initially this knowledge consists of facts about population size, local economy, agriculture, leaders, and popular deities worshiped in the area.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The owner feels a powerful desire to continue watching, and if she does so while taking no other breaks except to eat and sleep, the information continues unabated. Over the course of 1d10 days, the heart reveals much more: the subtle social, religious, and economic influences of the settlement; the strengths and weaknesses of its leaders; and all the many secrets both pedestrian and profane that could be used to manipulate and extort those with power over the location. At this point, the heart begins to communicate to its new owner, suggesting courses of action that would bring her a higher social station, wealth, and power in that area. The heart's advice is almost always sound, but also always driven toward an unfortunate and evil outcome for someone&mdash;just not necessarily its owner. If the owner refuses to heed its advice, eventually the heart vanishes, seeking a more pliant puppet to manipulate.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Legends suggest that those who never question the heart's orders or decline its gift of knowledge eventually disappear to whatever cold place from which the heart originated.</p>",

The scepter's other end curls and forms an eyehook, to which is tied a leather strap. Strung along this strap are four small, copper bells. Each bell signifies a single concept related to rulership: authority, banishment, dominion, and imprisonment.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">An individual seeking to wield the scepter must first bond with the artifact by permanently offering it one use of her mythic power. Thereafter, the owner must always keep one use of power unspent to maintain the bond. If the owner expends all her mythic power, the bond breaks and the individual can no longer access any of the scepter's power until she reestablishes her bond of ownership.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Once bonded, the scepter can be wielded as a <i>+6 brilliant energy light mace</i> that grants a +4 enhancement bonus to its bonded owner's Charisma score. In addition, the owner can expend one use of mythic power and ring the scepter's bells to produce the following effects:</p><ul><li>The wielder can ring the bell of authority to cast <i>command</i> targeting any non-mythic creature.</li><li>The wielder can ring the bell of banishment to cast <i>dismissal</i> upon any non-mythic outsider with a CR at least 3 less than the wielder's total class level plus her tier.</li><li>The wielder can ring the bell of dominion to cast <i>sanctuary</i> on any non-mythic creature.</li><li>The wielder can ring the bell of imprisonment to cast <i>forcecage</i> on any non-mythic creature with a CR at least 3 less than the wielder's total class level plus her tier.</li></ul><p class=\"stat-block\">The caster level for all four effects is equal to the owner's total character level plus her tier. When she rings a bell, she can also expend an additional use of mythic power to increase the DC of the spell-like ability's saving throw by 10.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Lastly, the owner can use the scepter to appoint a mythic agent to be a protector and advocate of the owner's people. When she does so, she bestows 1d4 uses of mythic power upon that creature that last for 1 month if the creature is mythic, or until they are spent if the creature is non-mythic. If the agent is mythic, these points increase the agent's maximum number of mythic uses for the month. If the champion is non-mythic, as long as that agent retains at least one use of mythic power, it gains the hard to kill and surge base mythic abilities.</p>",

Though non-mythic creatures can board the ship as passengers, the <i>Silver Maiden</i> requires a mythic creature to be its captain. If the ship currently has no captain, a mythic character can claim the captaincy by touching the ship's wheel and stating her desire to be captain. The captain then serves until death or voluntarily retirement. Upon assuming the captaincy, the captain becomes aware of all of the ship's powers, and can propel the ship completely unaided from anywhere aboard the vessel, whether sailing the high seas of a terrestrial world or gliding through the vast blackness of deep space.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">At will, the captain can expend two uses of mythic power to launch the <i>Silver Maiden </i>into outer space. Once in space, the ship can sail through the vacuum at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a voyage between two planets within a solar system takes 2d20 days, and a voyage to another star system takes 2d20 weeks (or more at the GM's discretion). The captain must know which world she wishes to travel to (as if the captain cast <i>greater teleport</i>). When the ship arrives at its destination, it slowly descends to the surface (as the <i>feather fall</i> spell), and typically lands in a body of water. Once earthbound, the ship moves as a standard sailing ship. If the planet has no water or comparable liquid, the ship lands on solid ground and is unable to move until the captain once again launches the ship back into space.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The <i>Silver Maiden </i>can also sail the Outer Planes. At will, the captain can expend three uses of mythic power to transport the ship to another plane, as the <i>plane shift</i> spell. When the ship arrives at its extraplanar destination, it appears in a body of water or comparable liquid, 1 to 100 miles from the captain's intended destination. If the plane has no water (such as the Plane of Earth) the ship appears on solid ground, and is unable to move until the captain transports it to another plane. If the plane has neither water nor a solid surface, such as the Plane of Air, the ship continues to slowly fall (as the <i>feather fall</i> spell) until the captain transports it to another plane.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The <i>Silver Maiden</i> protects its passengers from the environmental dangers of deep space and the outer planes, and can even sail the molten surface of a star. At all times, the ship simulates a comfortable temperature and gravity normal for its current captain's home world. This protection extends 10 feet from the exterior of the vessel.</p>",

                    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Formed of meteoric adamantine, the massive anvil known as the <i>Trueforge</i> appears and vanishes according to unknowable whims&mdash;perhaps those of a greater power, perhaps its own. A creature with sufficient power and knowledge can bind the <i>Trueforge</i> to a fixed location to best take advantage of its power.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Labor at the <i>Trueforge</i> requires both supreme skill and mythic power. Non-mythic creatures are affected as the <i>feeblemind</i> spell (DC 30) for daring to use the forge, and can't use the forge's abilities even if they succeed at their saving throws.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">When toiling at the <i>Trueforge</i>, a mythic creature can create magical weapons and armor with a cost up to her mythic tier squared times 2,000 gp, ignoring the nonmagical cost of the item created. For example, a 10th-tier character could craft a magic weapon of a +10 enhancement equivalent, worth 200,000 gp plus the cost of the weapon itself. The item forged must be at least partially metal, such as a breastplate or spear. Creating such an item requires only half the usual value of raw materials. However, to create items involving exotic materials (such as adamantine), the creator must use and have access to the normal amount of the material.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Regardless of the materials involved, it takes 1 day of labor to forge a nonmagical light or one-handed weapon, shield, or suit of light armor; 2 days to forge a suit of medium armor or two-handed weapon; and 3 days to forge a suit of heavy armor. For items with magical properties, square the number of days of labor and multiply by 1,000 to determine the total gold piece value. For example, completing an item with magical properties worth 144,000 gp or less requires 12 days of work. The crafter must labor continuously on the item, not sleeping until work is completed, though she's kept awake and vigorous through the magic of the forge. If the work is interrupted for more than 1 hour at a time or more than 2 hours in a single day, the item is ruined, and half the value of the raw materials wasted.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">In addition to making normal and magical weapons and armor, the <i>Trueforge</i> can repair a broken magic item, generally in half the number of days it would take to make it from scratch. It can even repair or create an artifact, though such a task requires months of preparation to gather the proper materials followed by weeks of labor at the forge.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Only one person can work the forge at a time. As the crafter labors, the <i>Trueforge</i> feeds on her mythic power and life energy, drawing it into the item forged. Forging nonmagical items carries less risk. The crafter must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save at the start of each day of work or gain 2 permanent negative levels. For magic items, the save DC is equal to 25 plus the number of days worked thus far. At the start of each day of labor, the crafter must expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to the number of days worked so far plus one.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If the crafter accumulates a number of negative levels equal to her own character level or exhausts her mythic power, the labor proves fatal at the end of the day. Normally, this ruins the work in progress, but if this occurs on the final day of work, the crafter finishes the item as she dies. Her soul enters the item, making it an intelligent item with the crafter's personality&mdash;and likely some of her abilities, as determined by the GM.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Creatures immune to level drain, whether by innate nature or magical protection, can't use the <i>Trueforge</i>.</p>",
