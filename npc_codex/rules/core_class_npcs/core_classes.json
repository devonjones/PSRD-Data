    "body": "<p>The Pathfinder RPG gives you a phenomenal number of character options&mdash;battle or healing clerics, greatsword or longbow fighters, pickpocket or trap-finding rogues, mind-controller or undead-creator wizards, and so on.</p><p>This section gives you useful and interesting NPCs at levels 1&ndash;20 for each of the 11 core classes. In general, if an NPC's character level is odd, the character is a fairly normal example of that class. For example, the 3rd-level wizard is a universalist \"battle mage\" and the 5th-level wizard is a typical transmuter, either of which is suitable for any common situation where you need a wizard stat block in a combat. NPCs with even-numbered character levels get more experimental and thematic. For example, the 2nd-level wizard is an enchanter \"street magician,\" and the 4th-level wizard is a diviner \"investigator,\" which have more specialized uses. This structure means that no matter what CR you need for an encounter, at most you're just one character level away from a standard character. For example, if you need a CR 3 (4th-level) wizard, you could add a level to the 3rd-level wizard or subtract a level from the 5th-level wizard (of course, adding a level is easier than subtracting a level).</p><p>All of the NPCs in this section use the \"heroic\" set of base ability scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) and have gear according to the Heroic Level column of the NPC Gear table.</p><p>In general, the NPCs do not list mundane gear such as rope, torches, belt pouches, and so on unless it is vital to the character (clerics have a holy symbol, rogues with Disable Device have thieves' tools, and so on). You can assume that an NPC is geared appropriately for his or her profession or adventuring career, and if cost is ever a factor, you can mark off some of the character's extra gear for this purpose or for expendable items such as potions, nearly expended wands, and so on.</p><p>The three most common uses for NPCs in this section are as antagonists, allies, and player characters.</p>",

For example, if the stat block is for a human character and you need a half-elf, each of those races has a bonus to one ability score of your choice, so you don't have to alter the character's ability scores. Unless you let your players see the stat block, they probably won't notice that the \"half-elf\" has a different feat instead of Skill Focus and more skill points than she should. If you use a human as a dwarf or a half-orc as a gnome, you usually can hand-wave the minor differences between the races and just use the stat block as presented.</p><p>The remainder of this section explains specific choices for each of the classes in this chapter.</p>",
