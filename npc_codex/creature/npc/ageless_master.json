He then closes with a single opponent to deliver an Improved Vital Strike combined with Stunning Fist. If successful, he makes a full attack with his flurry of blows in the next round, attempting to finish the hampered opponent. He uses this tactic whenever possible, using flurry of blows or Power Attack only against targets that have already had their AC compromised from being stunned or tripped. Otherwise, he uses his mobility and high Acrobatics skill to move in and out of melee. When fighting four or more opponents, the monk activates his feather token (whip) and targets spellcasters first with Stunning Fist combined with Medusa's Wrath.</p><p class='stat-block-1'><b>Base Statistics </b>Without barkskin and bear's endurance, the monk's statistics are</p><p class='stat-block-1'><b>AC </b>32, touch 27, flat-footed 29</p><p class='stat-block-1'><b>hp </b>113</p><p class='stat-block-1'><b>Fort </b>+16</p><p class='stat-block-1'><b>Con </b>10.</p>",
