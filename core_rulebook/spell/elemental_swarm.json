    "body": "<p>This spell opens a portal to an Elemental Plane and summons elementals from it. A druid can choose any plane (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water); a cleric opens a portal to the plane matching his domain.</p><p>When the spell is complete, 2d4 Large elementals appear. Ten minutes later, 1d4 Huge elementals appear. Ten minutes after that, one greater elemental appears. Each elemental has maximum hit points per HD. Once these creatures appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell.</p><p>The elementals obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the elementals. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.</p><p>When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.</p>",
