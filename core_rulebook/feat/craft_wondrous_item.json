To create a wondrous item, you must use up raw materials costing half of its base price. See the magic item creation rules in Magic Items for more information.</p><p class=\"stat-block-2\">You can also mend a broken wondrous item if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the raw materials and half the time it would take to craft that item.</p>",
