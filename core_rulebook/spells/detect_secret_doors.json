Only passages, doors, or openings that have been specifically constructed to escape detection are detected by this spell. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.</p><p><i>1st Round</i>Presence or absence of secret doors.</p><p><i>2nd Round</i>Number of secret doors and the location of each. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.</p><p><i>Each Additional Round</i>The mechanism or trigger for one particular secret portal closely examined by you. Each round, you can turn to detect secret doors in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.</p>",
