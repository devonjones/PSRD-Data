Drow have no love for anyone but themselves, and are adept at manipulating other creatures.

Some stories tell that given the right circumstances, a particularly hateful elf might turn into a drow, though such a transformation would require a truly heinous individual.</p>",

Each house is also associated with a demon lord patron.
