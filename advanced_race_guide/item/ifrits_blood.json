    "body": "<p id=\"ifrit's-blood\">Ifrit alchemists claim to make this thick red oil from their own blood&mdash;hence the morbid name&mdash;but this claim is almost certainly false. Ifrit's blood ignites upon contact with air, but burns slowly and is unsuitable for use as a splash weapon. A creature can apply a flask of ifrit's blood to a weapon as a standard action, wreathing the weapon in vibrant red flames for 1 minute. The oil deals 1 point of fire damage on each successful attack with the weapon and deals 1 point of fire damage to the weapon itself, bypassing the weapon's hardness if any part of it is made of wood. If the oil is applied to a creature's natural weapons or unarmed strikes, the creature takes 1 point of fire damage each round (though its fire immunity or resistance still applies).</p>",
