    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A frenzychip is installed into a creature's brain. Successful implantation leaves no trace of the operation. Once in place, a frenzychip patches directly in to the patient's motor skills and emotions. As long as she's not fatigued or exhausted, the user of a frenzychip can activate it as a swift action. While active, it grants a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Dexterity, a +1 morale bonus on Reflex saving throws, and a -2 penalty on Will saving throws. The user may use a frenzychip for up to 10 rounds per day, though the rounds need not be consecutive. Once the effects end, she becomes fatigued for twice as many rounds as she was under the frenzychip's effects.</p>",
