    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A cybernetic leg completely replaces a normal leg, from the hip to the foot. It can take the place of a leg lost to a severing wound. The leg is fully functional and no different in appearance from a regular leg, although cyberart can be added to the leg at no additional cost. A cybernetic leg does not increase a user's Strength score. If both legs are replaced, they increase the user's base land speed by 10 feet and grant a +5 bonus to CMD against trip attempts and a +5 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The listed price, implantation, and install DC are for having two legs installed. A single cybernetic leg costs half the price and half the listed implantation value, but no significant bonus is granted to a creature with only one cybernetic leg. Both legs (or all legs, in the case of multi-legged creatures) must be replaced for the above benefits to take effect.</p>",
