When a gravity rifle is on sustained setting, it can move objects weighing no more than 350 pounds up to 20 feet per round, and the wielder gains a +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks; she still substitutes her Intelligence modifier in place of her Strength or Dexterity modifier when calculating her CMB for these maneuvers.</p>",
