At 4th level, he suffers no penalties on attack rolls, can make attacks of opportunity while grappling, and retains his Dexterity bonus to AC when pinning an opponent or when grappled. At 8th level, a tetori gains the grab special attack when using unarmed strikes (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 301), and can use this ability against creatures his own size or smaller by spending 1 point from his <i>ki</i> pool, or against larger creatures by spending 2 points from his <i>ki</i> pool. At 15th level, a tetori gains the constrict special attack (<i>Bestiary</i> 298), inflicting his unarmed strike damage on any successful grapple check. This ability replaces flurry of blows.</p>",
