The cad gains a +1 bonus on disarm, dirty trick, and steal combat maneuver checks. The cad also gains a +1 bonus to CMD when attacked with the disarm, dirty trick, and steal combat  maneuvers. These bonuses increase by 1 for every four levels after 2nd (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level).  This ability replaces bravery. </p>",
