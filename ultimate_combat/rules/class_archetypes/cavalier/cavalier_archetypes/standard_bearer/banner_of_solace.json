    "body": "<p id=\"banner-of-solace\">At 11th level, a standard bearer's banner becomes an even more potent symbol of protection and inspiration to those around him. Once per day, while his banner is displayed, the standard bearer can wave it through the air as a full-round action, granting all allies within 60 feet temporary hit points equal to 1/2 his cavalier level, and a +2 morale bonus on their next damage rolls. At 15th level, and every four levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1 (to a maximum of +4 at 19th level). The temporary hit points last for 10 minutes or until depleted, whichever occurs first. This ability replaces mighty charge. </p>",
