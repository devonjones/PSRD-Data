    "body": "<p id=\"transfixing-charge\">At 20th level, a gendarme represents the epitome of mounted combat. Whenever he makes a charge attack while mounted, he deals triple the normal damage (quadruple if using a lance); this damage includes all increases from the Spirited Charge feat and from the use of a lance. In addition, if the gendarme confirms a critical hit on a charge attack while mounted, the attack deals maximum damage for the weapon wielded. Additional damage from weapon properties, magic effects, precision-based bonuses, or other increases are rolled normally. This ability replaces supreme charge.</p>",
