    "body": "<p id=\"horrific-visage\">At 1st level, you can draw upon your hag ancestor to cause one target to perceive you as having a horrifying appearance. As a standard action, you can force one target within 30 feet to make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier) or be shaken for 1 round for every 2 sorcerer levels you possess (minimum 1 round). This is a mind-affecting, fear-based ability. This fear does not stack with other fear effects. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>",
