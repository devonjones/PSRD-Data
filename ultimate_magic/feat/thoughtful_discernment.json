This acts like the <i>discern lies</i> spell, but instead of affecting a creature, it affects a single statement a creature has made. </p><p class=\"stat-block-2\">For example, if the king told you, &ldquo;My daughter is in the monster's dungeon&rdquo; before you left to find her, as long as the king said that to you within the past day, you can use this feat to determine whether or not the king deliberately and knowingly lied to you when he made that statement.</p>",
