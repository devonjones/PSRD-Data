A flare spell causes a creature that takes fire or electricity damage from the affected spell to become dazzled for a number of rounds equal to the actual level of the spell. A flaring spell only affects spells with a fire, light, or electricity descriptor. A flaring spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level. </p>",
