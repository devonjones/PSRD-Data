    "body": "<p>A monster (or group of monsters) attacks the kingdom. The GM picks a claimed hex in the kingdom in which the monster is active. The CR of the monster encounter is equal to the party's APL + 1d4 &mdash; 1. You can personally deal with the monster (earning XP and treasure normally for your efforts) or succeed at a Stability check to eliminate it (which doesn't affect you or the kingdom's statistics). If the monster is not defeated this turn, Unrest increases by 4. If the kingdom's Unrest is 5 or higher, the monster's hex becomes unclaimed&mdash;this is in addition to losing control of hexes in the Upkeep phase because of the kingdom's high Unrest score.</p>",
