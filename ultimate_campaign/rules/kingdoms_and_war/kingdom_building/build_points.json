    "body": "<p>The units of a kingdom's wealth and productivity are build points (BP). Build points are an abstraction representing the kingdom's expendable assets, not just gold in the treasury. Build points include raw materials (such as livestock, lumber, land, seed, and ore), tangible goods (such as wagons, weapons, and candles), and people (artisans, laborers, and colonists). Together, these assets represent the labor and productive output of your citizens.</p><p>You spend BP on tasks necessary to develop and protect your kingdom&mdash;planting farms, creating roads, constructing buildings, raising armies, and so on. These things are made at your command, but they are not <i>yours</i>. The cities, roads, farms, and buildings belong to the citizens who build them and use them to live and work every day, and those acts of living and working create more BP for the kingdom. As the leaders, you use your power and influence to direct the economic and constructive activity of your kingdom, deciding what gets built, when, and where.</p><p>Build points don't have a precise exchange rate to gold pieces because they don't represent exact amounts of specific resources. For example, you can't really equate the productivity of a blacksmith with that of a stable, as their goods are used for different things and aren't produced at the same rate, but both of them contribute to a kingdom's overall economy. In general, 1 BP is worth approximately 4,000 gp; use this value to get a sense of how costly various kingdom expenditures are. In practice, it is not a simple matter to convert one currency to the other, but there are certain ways for your PC to spend gp to increase the kingdom's BP or withdraw BP and turn them into gold for your character to spend.</p><p>Providing a seed amount of BP at the start of kingdom building means your kingdom isn't starving for resources in the initial months. Whether you acquire these funds on your own or with the help of an influential NPC is decided by the GM, and sets the tone for much of the campaign.</p>",

            "body": "<p>In many cases, a kingdom's initial BP come from a source outside your party. A wealthy queen may want to tame some of the wilderness on her kingdom's borders, or a merchant's guild may want to construct a trading post to increase trade with distant lands. Regardless of the intent, the work involved to create a new settlement costs thousands of gold pieces&mdash;more than most adventurers would want to spend on mundane things like jails, mills, and piers.</p><p>It is an easy matter for the GM to provide these funds in the form of a quest reward. A wealthy queen may grant you minor titles and BP for your treasury if you kill a notorious bandit and turn his ruined castle into a town, or a guild may provide you with a ship full of goods and workers and enough BP to start a small colony on a newly discovered, resource-rich continent. In exchange for this investment, the sponsor expects you to be a vassal or close ally; in some cases, you may be required to pay back these BP (such as at a rate of 1 BP per turn) or provide tribute to the patron on an ongoing basis (such as at a rate of 10% of your income per turn, minimum 1 BP).</p><p>An appropriate starting amount is 50 BP. This amount is enough to keep a new kingdom active for a few turns while it establishes its own economy, but it is still at risk of collapse from mismanagement or bad luck.</p><p>As the initial citizens represented by this BP investment are probably loyal to the sponsor, taking action against the sponsor may anger those people and cause trouble. For example, if you rebuff the queen's envoy, your citizens may see this as a snub against the queen and rebel.</p><p>Your responsibility to the sponsor usually falls into one of the following categories, based on the loan arrangement.</p>",
